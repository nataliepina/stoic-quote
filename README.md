## What is Modern Stoicism?

"Stoicism is a philosophy of life, a practical guide to applying wisdom to your daily choices, focused on living life as a thriving rational being, characterized by excellence in judgement and the fulfilled happiness that is to the mind what robust healthy fitness is to the body."

## Daily Stoicism

I am utilizing this as a place to store and share my favorite stoic quotes. Teachings by Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus. I hope you enjoy!
